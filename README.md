Comes with the Pankod CLI tool to streamline the creation of new components. By using the CLI tool, you may easily add pages, class components or functional components to your project and have all the required actions, reducers and imports are automatically created for you.

To start the CLI, you may run the following npm command:  

```

npm run cli

```


After starting, an interactive menu will let you configure the component the be created. Firstly, you'll be asked for the type of the component whether it's a page, functional component or class component. Then you'll be prompted with the other options relevant to your selection of the component type.

  
  

After answering questions it generates files in miliseconds.
